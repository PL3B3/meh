Even though i did debate in high school I never really got too good at persuading people, which is part of the reason I've come to Georgia Tech for CompSci, to be able to build a machine that does the persuasion for me. And because a lot of marketing is reliant on persuasion, Mailchimp and I have a little bit of interest convergence here, especially with the software engineering position, because it uses linux, which I'm a big fan of, and the research position because I think that studying persuasion is necessary because it can be dangerous in the wrong hands but in the right hands, tools for enhancing persuasion could give someone opportunities that they didn't have before. Like, let's say english wasn't your first language and you still want to reach out to customers who speak english. Now, I have a little bit of research experience because of a science fair project I did in Machine learning, but I'd like to believe my greatest asset is my very unique name, which is KEvin. So, have I persuaded you to be interested?
