proof for weird theorem thing

*A: more vectors than entries per vecotr -> dependent
*B: only dependent when one vector is linear combo of others

consider the following: a 2 * 3 matrix

a b c
d e f

a
d

and 

b
e

are the first two vectors. *A applies b/c it's 2 * 3. So cf must be in the span of the first two

THis is always true because 
	Case a: there's a zero vecotr: you win b/c it's just 0* all the other vectors
	Case b: no zero vector: two vectors in 2d span a plane of all 2d bois. SImilarly, any <K> of <K>d vectors spans the whole "dimension" -> any other <K>d vector is incluyendo. 

THis is the true meaning of free variables.
