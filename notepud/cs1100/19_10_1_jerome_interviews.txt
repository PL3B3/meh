total domination of the interview??

-What makes it succcessful?
	it's 2-way: make sure the company is actually good to work
	good sign is when they provide you a contact
	
	You should demonstrate personality-culture fit. It's quite subjective
	Problemos?
		Being the big false
		Being the big ass
		Being over or under confident

	Behavioral vs Technical:

	Behavioral: Name some thing you did or experienced
		S: Scenario? Describe it
		T: Task: What did you have to do?
		A: Action?
		R: Results. show it was succ. This is really important!!	

	LOS technical? Present a problem and u must do the solve?
		Pls explain...use the chublet methods

	Remember:
		Take a shower and refuse the sweat and the bad breath
		Follow up in 1-2 days
		Ask questions about what type of interview
		You can politely turn down a question

-Huh? What does the career fair search for?
	PPL skills
	they know what the company is
	ARTICULATE your personality (hoho are you a quality? the big ableism?)
	be able to explain your projects
